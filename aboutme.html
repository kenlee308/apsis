Started in IT and Industrial Automation, where I cut my teeth on systems and problem-solving—now I’m stepping into human-AI collaboration and robots with a passion for redefining what’s possible. Self-taught tinkerer with a knack for hands-on learning, I’m building my own path through Apsis Inc. to explore how we evolve with machines. Not chasing titles or traditional gigs—just here to create, challenge norms, and spark ideas. Let’s rethink the future together.

My ultimate goal is not just to redefine human potential but to catalyze a paradigm shift in how humanity evolves with technology—becoming a linchpin in a symbiotic future.
